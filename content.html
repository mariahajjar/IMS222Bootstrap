  <h1>What We See and Assume</h1>
      <p>Many times, more often than not, you may know someone who has a favorite
        character. You could assume this character to be from their favorite TV show or movie.
        However, you would come to realization that this favorite character is in fact a real human
        being as is everyone else. This character in particular is realistic, a human being just like anyone else.
        However, they have been made to be famous, being highly praised. This character happens to be celebrity. 
        When you hear their name and you know exactly who everyone is talking about. I would say social media has 
        a great impact as to how so many individuals know this one character. How one character can have such a 
        large following is amazing, though unfortunate, but we should keep in mind to look up to the good in 
        people and good people in general.

  <h2>What We Don't Know and Consider</h2>
  <p>We do not know the situation of individuals' lives. From fans to celebrities alike, they could be
    going through something we are not aware of. This all ties back to the 
    impact social media has on our generation, because people put so much emphasis on celebrities without 
    taking the time to think about who they really are, both subjectively and objectively. Moreover, a 
    celebrity can be just about anyone, regardless of their status. This includes someone who is a famous 
    singer to a politician. When thinking about hierarchy in society, the celebrity can be someone 
    who is popular compared to someone who has been made to feel inferior. That superiority, in turn, can do 
    more harm than good to others, depending on the situation. In reality, no one is perfect or superior over the 
    other; we are all equal at the end of the day. Moreover, we must live by the Golden Rule, to treat others as 
    we would like to be treated. That applies to our expectations and judgments as well.
